# `BallotLife` – Secure, Transparent, and Decentralized Voting

BallotLife is a blockchain-powered voting platform designed to bring secure, transparent, and tamper-proof decision-making to real-world communities. By leveraging smart contracts and identity verification, BallotLife ensures that every vote counts and cannot be altered. Whether for civic initiatives, organizational decisions, or community-based polls, the platform empowers inclusive participation through trustless technology.

🔐 Key Features
1. Secure Login with Identity Verification
Users sign in through a secure, identity-verified process. This ensures that only eligible participants can create or cast votes.

2. Create New Polls Easily
Authorized users can create new voting sessions by providing the poll title, description, and duration.

3. Add Multiple Candidates
Poll creators can dynamically add candidates or choices to their polls before launch.

4. Live Voting and Real-Time Results
Once voting is open, users can vote securely. Results are updated in real time with blockchain-backed accuracy.

5. Close Voting
Polls can be set to close automatically after a deadline or be closed manually by the creator once a decision is finalized.

6. Transparent and Immutable Voting Records
All votes are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and preventing tampering or manipulation.

##Get started
To get started, you might want to explore the project directory structure and the default configuration file. Working with this project in your development environment will not affect any production deployment or identity tokens.

To learn more before you start working with `BallotLife`, see the following documentation available online:

- [Quick Start](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/deploy-locally)
- [SDK Developer Tools](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install)
- [Motoko Programming Language Guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/motoko)
- [Motoko Language Quick Reference](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/language-manual)

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd BallotLife/
dfx help
dfx canister --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
